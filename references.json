    "abstract": "Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) can be used to reconstruct three-dimensional (3D) volumes, or tomograms, from a series of tilted two-dimensional images of biological objects in their near-native states in situ or in vitro. 3D subvolumes, or subtomograms, containing particles of interest can be extracted from tomograms, aligned, and averaged in a process called subtomogram averaging (STA). STA overcomes the low signal to noise ratio within the individual subtomograms to generate structures of the particle(s) of interest. In recent years, cryo-ET with STA has increasingly been capable of reaching subnanometer resolution due to improvements in microscope hardware and data processing strategies. There has also been an increase in the number and quality of software packages available to process cryo-ET data with STA. In this review, we describe and assess the data processing strategies available for cryo-ET data and highlight the recent software developments which have enabled the extraction of high-resolution information from cryo-ET datasets.",

    "abstract": "The presynaptic terminal contains a complex network of filaments whose precise organization and functions are not yet understood. The cryoelectron tomography experiments reported in this study indicate that these structures play a prominent role in synaptic vesicle release. Docked synaptic vesicles did not make membrane to membrane contact with the active zone but were instead linked to it by tethers of different length. Our observations are consistent with an exocytosis model in which vesicles are first anchored by long (&gt;5 nm) tethers that give way to multiple short tethers once vesicles enter the readily releasable pool. The formation of short tethers was inhibited by tetanus toxin, indicating that it depends on soluble N-ethyl-maleimide sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptor complex assembly. Vesicles were extensively interlinked via a set of connectors that underwent profound rearrangements upon synaptic stimulation and okadaic acid treatment, suggesting a role of these connectors in synaptic vesicle mobilization and neurotransmitter release.",

    "abstract": "Synaptic vesicles are embedded in a complex filamentous network at the presynaptic terminal. Before fusion, vesicles are linked to the active zone (AZ) by short filaments (tethers). The identity of the molecules that form and regulate tethers remains unknown, but Rab3-interacting molecule (RIM) is a prominent candidate, given its central role in AZ organization. In this paper, we analyzed presynaptic architecture of RIM1α knockout (KO) mice by cryo–electron tomography. In stark contrast to previous work on dehydrated, chemically fixed samples, our data show significant alterations in vesicle distribution and AZ tethering that could provide a structural basis for the functional deficits of RIM1α KO synapses. Proteasome inhibition reversed these structural defects, suggesting a functional recovery confirmed by electrophysiological recordings. Altogether, our results not only point to the ubiquitin–proteasome system as an important regulator of presynaptic architecture and function but also show that the tethering machinery plays a critical role in exocytosis, converging into a structural model of synaptic vesicle priming by RIM1α.",

    "abstract": "The combination of scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) with analytical instruments has become one of the most indispensable analytical tools in materials science. A set of microscopic image/spectral intensities collected from many sampling points in a region of interest, in which multiple physical/chemical components may be spatially and spectrally entangled, could be expected to be a rich source of information about a material. To unfold such an entangled image comprising information and spectral features into its individual pure components would necessitate the use of statistical treatment based on informatics and statistics. These computer-aided schemes or techniques are referred to as multivariate curve resolution, blind source separation or hyperspectral image analysis, depending on their application fields, and are classified as a subset of machine learning. In this review, we introduce non-negative matrix factorization, one of these unfolding techniques, to solve a wide variety of problems associated with the analysis of materials, particularly those related to STEM, electron energy-loss spectroscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. This review, which commences with the description of the basic concept, the advantages and drawbacks of the technique, presents several additional strategies to overcome existing problems and their extensions to more general tensor decomposition schemes for further flexible applications are described.",

    "abstract": "A simple method to determine transient conformations of biological molecules is described. The two reactants (e.g. protein complex and ligand) are mixed rapidly by the coalescence of spray droplets containing one component, with a thin, grid-supported aqueous film containing the other. The transient state is then trapped by rapid freezing, and investigated later by cryo-microscopy. Images of conformations associated with reaction times of 1-100 ms can be achieved by adjusting the delay between the droplet impact and freezing. The droplets (typically 1 micron in diameter) are propelled onto the grid by an atomizer spray. It is shown that the droplets impinging on the liquid film spread rapidly over its surface under the influence of surface tension, and only weakly disturb the underlying film, partially displacing its contents away from the point of impact. Experiments with sprayed salt solutions, using vesicles derived from erythrocytes as micro-osmometers, indicate that rapid mixing occurs both through the film and laterally, by diffusion. The spraying process does not produce any detectable concentration changes due to drying in either the droplets or the film, and the method is applicable to high-resolution imaging.",

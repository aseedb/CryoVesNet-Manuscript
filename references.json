    "abstract": "  This paper introduces a network for volumetric segmentation that learns from sparsely annotated volumetric images. We outline two attractive use cases of this method: (1) In a semi-automated setup, the user annotates some slices in the volume to be segmented. The network learns from these sparse annotations and provides a dense 3D segmentation. (2) In a fully-automated setup, we assume that a representative, sparsely annotated training set exists. Trained on this data set, the network densely segments new volumetric images. The proposed network extends the previous u-net architecture from Ronneberger et al. by replacing all 2D operations with their 3D counterparts. The implementation performs on-the-fly elastic deformations for efficient data augmentation during training. It is trained end-to-end from scratch, i.e., no pre-trained network is required. We test the performance of the proposed method on a complex, highly variable 3D structure, the Xenopus kidney, and achieve good results for both use cases. ",

    "abstract": "  Multiple approaches to use deep learning for image restoration have recently been proposed. Training such approaches requires well registered pairs of high and low quality images. While this is easily achievable for many imaging modalities, e.g. fluorescence light microscopy, for others it is not. Cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) could profoundly benefit from improved denoising methods, unfortunately it is one of the latter. Here we show how recent advances in network training for image restoration tasks, i.e. denoising, can be applied to cryo-TEM data. We describe our proposed method and show how it can be applied to single cryo-TEM projections and whole cryo-tomographic image volumes. Our proposed restoration method dramatically increases contrast in cryo-TEM images, which improves the interpretability of the acquired data. Furthermore we show that automated downstream processing on restored image data, demonstrated on a dense segmentation task, leads to improved results. ",

We describe new methods in the UCSF ChimeraX molecular modeling package that take advantage of machine‐learning structure predictions, provide likelihood‐based fitting in maps, and compute per‐residue scores to identify modeling errors. Additional model‐building tools assist analysis of mutations, post‐translational modifications, and interactions with ligands. We present the latest ChimeraX model‐building capabilities, including several community‐developed extensions.

We present DeePiCt (deep picker in context), an open-source deep-learning framework for supervised segmentation and macromolecular complex localization in cryo-electron tomography. To train and benchmark DeePiCt on experimental data, we comprehensively annotated 20 tomograms of <jats:italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</jats:italic> for ribosomes, fatty acid synthases, membranes, nuclear pore complexes, organelles, and cytosol. By comparing DeePiCt to state-of-the-art approaches on this dataset, we show its unique ability to identify low-abundance and low-density complexes. We use DeePiCt to study compositionally distinct subpopulations of cellular ribosomes, with emphasis on their contextual association with mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum. Finally, applying pre-trained networks to a HeLa cell tomogram demonstrates that DeePiCt achieves high-quality predictions in unseen datasets from different biological species in a matter of minutes. The comprehensively annotated experimental data and pre-trained networks are provided for immediate use by the community.</jats:p>",

The cryoelectron tomography experiments reported in this study indicate that these structures play a prominent role in synaptic vesicle release. Docked synaptic vesicles did not make membrane to membrane contact with the active zone but were instead linked to it by tethers of different length. Our observations are consistent with an exocytosis model in which vesicles are first anchored by long (&amp;gt;5 nm) tethers that give way to multiple short tethers once vesicles enter the readily releasable pool. The formation of short tethers was inhibited by tetanus toxin, indicating that it depends on soluble N-ethyl-maleimide sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptor complex assembly. Vesicles were extensively interlinked via a set of connectors that underwent profound rearrangements upon synaptic stimulation and okadaic acid treatment, suggesting a role of these connectors in synaptic vesicle mobilization and neurotransmitter release.</jats:p>",

Here, we assess the performance of recently introduced hardware for cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) and subtomogram averaging (STA), an increasingly popular structural determination method for complex 3D specimens. We acquired cryo-ET datasets of EIAV virus-like particles (VLPs) on two contemporary cryo-EM systems equipped with different energy filters and direct electron detectors (DED), specifically a Krios G4, equipped with a cold field emission gun (CFEG), Thermo Fisher Scientific Selectris X energy filter, and a Falcon 4 DED; and a Krios G3i, with a Schottky field emission gun (XFEG), a Gatan Bioquantum energy filter, and a K3 DED. We performed constrained cross-correlation-based STA on equally sized datasets acquired on the respective systems. The resulting EIAV CA hexamer reconstructions show that both systems perform comparably in the 4-6 Å resolution range. In addition, by employing a recently introduced multiparticle refinement approach, we obtained a reconstruction of the EIAV CA hexamer at 2.9 Å. Our results demonstrate the potential of the new generation of energy filters and DEDs for STA, and the effects of using different processing pipelines on their STA outcomes.</jats:p>",

This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses — the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.</jats:p>",

Although the principles of ET have been known for decades, its use has gathered momentum only in recent years, thanks to technological advances and its combination with improved specimen preparation techniques. The rapid freezing/freeze-substitution preparation is applicable to whole cells and tissues, and it is the method of choice for ET investigations of cellular ultrastructure. The frozen-hydrated preparation provides the best possible structural preservation and allows the imaging of molecules, complexes, and supramolecular assemblies in their native state and their natural environment. Devoid of staining and chemical fixation artifacts, cryo-ET provides a faithful representation of both the surface and internal structure of molecules. In combination with advanced computational methods, such as molecular identification based on pattern recognition techniques, cryo-ET is currently the most promising approach to comprehensively map macromolecular architecture inside cellular tomograms. </jats:p>",

Synaptic vesicle dynamic spatial organization regulates synaptic transmission as well as synaptic plasticity. Because of their small size, synaptic vesicles require electron microscopy (EM) for their imaging, and their analysis is conducted manually. The manual annotation and segmentation of the hundreds to thousands of synaptic vesicles, is highly time consuming and limits the throughput of data collection. To overcome this limitation, we built an algorithm, mainly relying on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), capable of automatically detecting and localizing synaptic vesicles in electron micrographs. The algorithm was trained on murine synapses but we show that it works well on synapses from different species, ranging from zebrafish to human, and from different preparations. As output, we provide the vesicle count and coordinates, the nearest neighbor distance (nnd) and the estimate of the vesicles area. We also provide a graphical user interface (GUI) to guide users through image analysis, result visualization, and manual proof-reading. The application of our algorithm is especially recommended for images produced by transmission EM. Since this type of imaging is used routinely to investigate presynaptic terminals, our solution will likely be of interest for numerous research groups.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "napari 0.5.0\n\nThursday, Jul 11, 2024\n\nWe're happy to announce the release of napari 0.5.0!\nnapari is a fast, interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python.\nIt's designed for exploring, annotating, and analyzing multi-dimensional\nimages. It's built on Qt (for the GUI), VisPy (for performant GPU-based\nrendering), and the scientific Python stack (NumPy, SciPy, and friends).\n\nFor more information, examples, and documentation, please visit our website:\nhttps://napari.org/\n\nHighlights\n\nnapari 0.5.0 is the beginning of an architectural overhaul of napari. The\narchitecture improvements, which are still ongoing, enable more responsive\nasynchronous loading when slicing layers or panning and zooming in multiscale\n2D layers (#5816). There's\nseveral performance improvements, too, including faster points layer creation\nand updates (#6727).\n\nOther architectural changes, refactoring napari on top of\napp-model, have enabled us to\n(finally 😅) implement NAP-6, which allows\nplugins to organize their commands in defined menus in the napari menubar\nand application. Please read NAP-6 for all the\njuicy details, including how to request more menus if the existing ones don't\nmeet your needs. 📋 (#7011)\n\nAnother important development for plugins is that we have added fields for\naxis names and physical units in layers\n(#6979). If you implement a\nreader plugin, you can now specify the names of the axes in the data that you\nare reading in, and the physical units of the scale and other transformations.\nCurrently, napari is not using this information, but we will in upcoming\nversions, so plugins should start providing this information if they have it.\n\nThere's plenty of new features, too, including a polygon drawing tool when\npainting labels (#5806),\npinch-to-zoom (#5859), better\nways to show/hide individual layers when exploring your data\n(#5574)\n(#5618), creating a layer from\nan image or URL in your clipboard\n(#6532),\na new way to export figure-quality renderings from the canvas\n(#6730) (2D-only for now),\nand the ability to copy and paste spatial metadata (scale, translate, etc)\nbetween layers (#6864).\n\nYou'll also note a new little button on layer controls, including images:\n\n:alt: transform layer icon\n:width: 100px\n:align: center\n\n\nThis little button allows you to resize and rotate layers, enabling manual\nalignment (#6794)!\n\nAll in all, this release has over 20 new features and over 100 bug fixes and\nimprovements. Please see below for the full list of changes since 0.4.19.\n\nNew Features\n\n\n\nAdd layer slicer base class for async slicing (#5170)\n\nAdd unique_id attribute to Layer to uniquely identify layers (#5230)\n\nFeature: add layer contextual menu to hide not-selected layers (#5574)\n\nFeature: alt-click visibility eye to toggle show just that layer (hide others) (#5618)\n\nFeature: Add action to set current label to background (with keybinding) (#5672)\n\nUse Dims margin in layer slicing code (#5697)\n\nChanging brush size with mouse movement while holding specified modifiers (#5753)\n\nFeature: polygon drawing in the Labels layer (#5806)\n\nReplace old async loading with new approach (#5816)\n\nEnable pinch-to-zoom with vispy 0.13+ (#5859)\n\nKeep shading light for Surface fixed relative to camera (#5893)\n\nUse Request/Response pattern for Vectors layer (#5918)\n\nLock dimensions / axes while rolling (#5986)\n\nAdded support for features in surface layers (#6515)\n\nAdd creating image from clipboard (#6532)\n\nAdd viewer keybinds to select & show only next/prev layer and to toggle visibility of unselected (#6590)\n\nShow About napari action on macOS application menu (#6666)\n\nAdd points/shapes highlight color setting to Appereance settings and preference page (#6689)\n\nInclude features index as key in FormatStringEncoding (#6703)\n\nBetter export of figure-quality renderings from the canvas (#6730)\n\nAdd transform mode button for layers (#6794)\n\nReset all dims to be rollable (#6797)\n\nimplement copying spatial information via clipboard (#6864)\n\nAdd axis_labels and units to layers and transforms  (#6979)\n\nAlpha implementation of NAP-6 (#7011)\n\n\nImprovements\n\n\n\nuse app-model for file menu (#4865)\n\nShow platform specific shortcut while editing.

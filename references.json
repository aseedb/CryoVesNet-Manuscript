    "abstract": "  There is large consent that successful training of deep networks requires many thousand annotated training samples. In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU. The full implementation (based on Caffe) and the trained networks are available at http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net . ",

    "abstract": "  This paper introduces a network for volumetric segmentation that learns from sparsely annotated volumetric images. We outline two attractive use cases of this method: (1) In a semi-automated setup, the user annotates some slices in the volume to be segmented. The network learns from these sparse annotations and provides a dense 3D segmentation. (2) In a fully-automated setup, we assume that a representative, sparsely annotated training set exists. Trained on this data set, the network densely segments new volumetric images. The proposed network extends the previous u-net architecture from Ronneberger et al. by replacing all 2D operations with their 3D counterparts. The implementation performs on-the-fly elastic deformations for efficient data augmentation during training. It is trained end-to-end from scratch, i.e., no pre-trained network is required. We test the performance of the proposed method on a complex, highly variable 3D structure, the Xenopus kidney, and achieve good results for both use cases. ",

    "abstract": "The presynaptic terminal contains a complex network of filaments whose precise organization and functions are not yet understood. The cryoelectron tomography experiments reported in this study indicate that these structures play a prominent role in synaptic vesicle release. Docked synaptic vesicles did not make membrane to membrane contact with the active zone but were instead linked to it by tethers of different length. Our observations are consistent with an exocytosis model in which vesicles are first anchored by long (&gt;5 nm) tethers that give way to multiple short tethers once vesicles enter the readily releasable pool. The formation of short tethers was inhibited by tetanus toxin, indicating that it depends on soluble N-ethyl-maleimide sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptor complex assembly. Vesicles were extensively interlinked via a set of connectors that underwent profound rearrangements upon synaptic stimulation and okadaic acid treatment, suggesting a role of these connectors in synaptic vesicle mobilization and neurotransmitter release.",

Here, we assess the performance of recently introduced hardware for cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) and subtomogram averaging (STA), an increasingly popular structural determination method for complex 3D specimens. We acquired cryo-ET datasets of EIAV virus-like particles (VLPs) on two contemporary cryo-EM systems equipped with different energy filters and direct electron detectors (DED), specifically a Krios G4, equipped with a cold field emission gun (CFEG), Thermo Fisher Scientific Selectris X energy filter, and a Falcon 4 DED; and a Krios G3i, with a Schottky field emission gun (XFEG), a Gatan Bioquantum energy filter, and a K3 DED. We performed constrained cross-correlation-based STA on equally sized datasets acquired on the respective systems. The resulting EIAV CA hexamer reconstructions show that both systems perform comparably in the 4-6 Å resolution range. In addition, by employing a recently introduced multiparticle refinement approach, we obtained a reconstruction of the EIAV CA hexamer at 2.9 Å. Our results demonstrate the potential of the new generation of energy filters and DEDs for STA, and the effects of using different processing pipelines on their STA outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\r\n          The fusion of synaptic vesicles (SVs) with the plasma membrane (PM) proceeds through intermediate steps that remain poorly resolved. Additionally, the effect of persistent high or low exocytosis activity on intermediate steps remains unknown. Through time-resolved cryo-electron tomography, we ordered events into a sequence. Following stimulation, proximal tethered SVs rapidly form additional tethers with the PM. Simultaneously, fusion initiation occurs by membrane curvature (‘buckling’) of the SV and PM. It is followed by the formation of a fusion pore, and the collapse of SV membrane. At this time, membrane-proximal, but not membrane-distal, vesicles lose their interconnections, allowing them to move towards the PM. Two mutations of SNAP-25 that arrests or disinhibit spontaneous release, respectively, both caused a loss of interconnectors, while the disinhibiting mutant also caused a loss of membrane proximal multiple-tethered SVs. Overall, tether formation and connector dissolution is triggered by stimulation and respond to the spontaneous fusion rate. These morphological observations likely correspond to the transition of SVs from one functional pool to another.",

    "abstract": "▪ Abstract  Electron tomography (ET) is uniquely suited to obtain three-dimensional reconstructions of pleomorphic structures, such as cells, organelles or supramolecular assemblies. Although the principles of ET have been known for decades, its use has gathered momentum only in recent years, thanks to technological advances and its combination with improved specimen preparation techniques. The rapid freezing/freeze-substitution preparation is applicable to whole cells and tissues, and it is the method of choice for ET investigations of cellular ultrastructure. The frozen-hydrated preparation provides the best possible structural preservation and allows the imaging of molecules, complexes, and supramolecular assemblies in their native state and their natural environment. Devoid of staining and chemical fixation artifacts, cryo-ET provides a faithful representation of both the surface and internal structure of molecules. In combination with advanced computational methods, such as molecular identification based on pattern recognition techniques, cryo-ET is currently the most promising approach to comprehensively map macromolecular architecture inside cellular tomograms.",

    "abstract": "We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.",

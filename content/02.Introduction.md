## Introduction

The fine architecture of cells can be investigated by cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) [@doi:10.1016/j.jmb.2021.167187].
Cellular structures are preserved down to the atomic scale through vitrification and observation of the samples in a fully hydrated state.
When a macromolecule is present in a sufficient number of copies in the cells imaged by cryo-ET, it is possible to obtain its atomic structure in situ using subtomogram averaging [@doi:10.1101/2022.01.10.475481; @doi:10.1038/s41596-021-00648-5].
Cellular cryo-ET datasets are usually extremely complex, making them difficult to analyze. 
This is aggravated by the sensitivity of biological samples to electron radiation, which limits the signal-to-noise ratio in cryo-ET datasets [@doi:10.1146/annurev.biochem.73.011303.074112].
Tomographic reconstructions are generated from a series of images of the sample acquired at different viewing angles.
The geometry of the samples prevents acquisition at certain angles, resulting in anisotropic spatial coverage.
The resolution in the directions close to the axis of the electron beam incident on the untilted sample is strongly reduced. 
This effect, commonly referred to as the missing-wedge artifact, further complicates data analysis. 
In particular, organelles fully bounded by a membrane appear to have holes at their top and bottom (relative to the electron beam axis) [@doi:10.1146/annurev.biochem.73.011303.074112].

The synapse is the functional cellular contact at which information is transmitted from a neuron to another. 
The former neuron is called presynaptic and the latter is postsynaptic. 
In most cases, the signal is transmitted by the release of neurotransmitters into the intercellular space.
Neurotransmitters are stored in SVs and are released following the fusion of a vesicle with the presynaptic plasma membrane.
A synapse contains hundreds of SVs and their mobility and recruitability for neurotransmitter release depends on inter-vesicle interactions through so-called connector structures [@doi:10.1083/jcb.200908082 ]. 
The characterization of these interactions can be performed automatically with the pyto software, which implements a hierarchical connectivity approach to detect and annotate connectors [@doi:10.1016/j.jsb.2016.10.004]. For accurate connector segmentation, an exceptionally precise segmentation of SVs is prerequisite.
To date, this SV segmentation has been achieved manually, but given the massive number of SVs per dataset, it is an extremely time-consuming process. 
Typically, one person spends 3 to 8 working days to segment a single dataset.
Attempts to perform this task automatically based on classical computer vision algorithms have not yielded sufficiently accurate performance [@doi:10.1016/j.jsb.2014.02.015].  
To alleviate this situation, we considered applying deep learning methods.

Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been successfully employed to segment cryo-ET data [@doi:10.1038/nmeth.4405]. 
Although entirely satisfying for visualization purposes, this approach has not met the requirements of pyto.
A recent publication described accurate SV segmentation of transmission electron microscopy images using CNN, but it is limited to 2-dimensional images of resin-embedded synapses [@doi:10.1523/ENEURO.0400-20.2021]. 
For our use-case, a common issue is that the input data consists of 2-dimensional images.
In the first study, cryo-ET data are decomposed in individual 2-dimensional slices, which are handed as seperate input to the CNN. 
The independent output prediction images are re-assembled in a 3-dimensional stack.[@doi:10.1038/nmeth.4405]
As discussed above, membranes oriented approximately parallel to the plane of the 2-dimensional tomographic images are not resolved.
In the absence of contextual knowledge of the other 2-dimensional images, the CNN fails to segment these regions of the vesicles.
Hence, spherical vesicles appear open, whereas we expect closed spherical objects.
To overcome this limitation, we used a U-Net CNN that takes 3-dimensional images as input.
U-Net architecture has been introduced in 2015 by Ronenberger et al. [@arxiv:1505.04597].
It consists of a contracting path, typical of CNN, and a symmetric expanding path. 
At each expansion step, the correspondingly cropped feature map of the contracting path is concatenated. 
The contracting path captures context, while the expanding path coupled with concatenation enables precise localization.
The U-Net architecture was developed to achieve a fast and accurate segmentation of biomedical two-dimensional images, with the requirement of only a small fraction of training data in comparison to previous CNNs.
*might be redundant*
*Arranging the sequence of convolution layers in the contraction path along with skip connection and concatenating into the expansion path bring significant privilege for medical and semantic segmentation.
Concurrent with the appearance of 3D convolutional neural networks (CNN) three-dimensional form of U-Net was also developed for volumetric image analysis.*

It was then extended to segment 3-dimensional biomedical images (3D U-Net) [@arxiv:1606.06650].
Weigert et al. [@doi:10.1038/s41592-018-0216-7] implemented a U-Net for content-aware restoration (CARE) of 3-dimensional fluorescence microscopy datasets. They showed that it can restore information from anisotropic and very noisy datasets.

We implemented a 3D U-Net based on CARE building blocks and trained it with manually segmented datasets. 
This method provided good accuracy and was only slightly affected by the missing wedge artifact. 
Nevertheless, it was not quite sufficient for our downstream pyto analysis.
Hence, we developed a post-processing method, which transforms the segmented objects into spheres and refines their radius and center location.
This leads to a substantial accuracy improvement, which are reflected in better pyto performance.
Additionally, we designed a multivariate ranking procedure, highlighting possibly wrongly segmented SVs. 
We also introduce a semi-automatic method to very quickly fix wrongly segmented and missed SVs.

Although our set of procedures was developed with the use case of SV segmentation in mind, it can be used to segment any other types of biological spherical vesicles, such as transport vesicles, secretory vesicles, endocytic vesicles, and extracellular vesicles.

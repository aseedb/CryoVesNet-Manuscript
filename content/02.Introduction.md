## Introduction

The rise of machine learning is sweeping the technological landscape.
Its use cases are highly diverse and are just starting to reach the scientific community.
Especially the graphical deep-learning approaches have been quite popular [@doi:10.1056/NEJMra1814259].
The graphical deep-learning approach is based around learning the description of the common attributes of a group or subset of a universe of objects [@doi:10.1017/S026988899700101X].

But also the field of cryo electron microscopy has recently recognized the benefits of machine/deep-learning approaches [@doi:10.1093/jmicro/dfz036].

The method of cryo-electron tomography (ET) utilises a series of tilted two-dimensional (2D) images to reconstruct a three-dimensional (3D) image of the imaged sample [@doi:10.1042/BCJ20200715].
It brings many advantages compared to other cryo-electron microscopy (EM) methods, as it yields images at in situ conditions.
Therefore cryo ET can help to reveal the natural cellular environment of protein(-complexes), their function as well as their structure.
In order to analyze the cellular context within a tomogram, cellular features are being segmented. 
Popular programs for manual segementation are IMOD and Amira [@doi:10.1006/jsbi.1996.0013; @doi:10.1016/B978-012387582-2/50040-X].
Currently manual segmentation is being considered the bottleneck in the worklow of cellular cryo-ET.

Problem 2D and 3D 

3D machine learning
We decided to teach our network with a real world dataset rather than using synthetic datasets, as it is often custom, as the synthetic datasets lack noise and ould represent a complete 360 degree 3D object, which our datasets cannot due to the missing wedge problem in cryo-ET.

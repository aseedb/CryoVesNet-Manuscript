## Introduction

The fine architecture of cells can be investigated by cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) [@doi:10.1016/j.jmb.2021.167187].
Cellular structures are preserved down to the atomic scale through vitrification and observation of the samples in a fully hydrated state.
When a macromolecule is present in a sufficient number of copies in the cells imaged by cryo-ET, it is possible to obtain its atomic structure in situ using subtomogram averaging [@doi:10.1101/2022.01.10.475481; @doi:10.1038/s41596-021-00648-5].
Cellular cryo-ET datasets are usually extremely complex, making them difficult to analyze. 
This is aggravated by the sensitivity of biological samples to electron radiation, which limits the signal-to-noise ratio in cryo-ET datasets [@doi:10.1146/annurev.biochem.73.011303.074112].
Tomographic reconstructions are generated from a series of images of the sample acquired at different viewing angles.
The geometry of the samples prevents acquisition at certain angles, resulting in anisotropic spatial coverage.
The resolution in the directions close to the axis of the electron beam incident on the untilted sample is strongly reduced. 
This effect, commonly referred to as the missing-wedge artifact, further complicates data analysis. 
In particular, organelles fully bounded by a membrane appear to have holes at their top and bottom (relative to the electron beam axis) [@doi:10.1146/annurev.biochem.73.011303.074112].

The synapse is the functional cellular contact at which information is transmitted from a neuron to another. 
The former neuron is called presynaptic and the latter is postsynaptic. 
In most cases, the signal is transmitted by the release of neurotransmitters into the intercellular space.
Neurotransmitters are stored in SVs and are released following the fusion of a vesicle with the presynaptic plasma membrane.
A synapse contains hundreds of SVs and their mobility and recruitability for neurotransmitter release depends on inter-vesicle interactions through so-called connector structures [@doi:10.1083/jcb.200908082 ]. 
The characterization of these interactions can be performed automatically with the pyto software, which implements a hierarchical connectivity approach to detect and annotate connectors [@doi:10.1016/j.jsb.2016.10.004]. For accurate connector segmentation, an exceptionally precise segmentation of SVs is prerequisite.
To date, this SV segmentation has been achieved manually, but given the massive number of SVs per dataset, it is an extremely time-consuming process. 
Typically, one person spends 3 to 8 working days to segment a single dataset.
Attempts to perform this task automatically based on classical computer vision algorithms have not yielded sufficiently accurate performance [@doi:10.1016/j.jsb.2014.02.015].  
To alleviate this situation, we considered applying deep learning methods.

Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been successfully employed to segment cryo-ET data [@doi:10.1038/nmeth.4405]. 
Although entirely satisfying for visualization purposes, this approach has not met the requirements of pyto.
A recent publication described accurate SV segmentation of transmission electron microscopy images using CNN, but it is limited to 2-dimensional (2D) images of resin-embedded synapses [@doi:10.1523/ENEURO.0400-20.2021].
In the first study, cryo-ET data are decomposed in individual 2D slices, which are handed as separate input to the CNN. 
The independent output 2D prediction images are reassembled in a 3-dimensional(3D) stack.[@doi:10.1038/nmeth.4405]
As discussed above, membranes oriented approximately parallel to the plane of the 2D tomographic images are not resolved.
In the absence of contextual knowledge of the other 2D images, the CNN fails to segment these regions of the vesicles.
Hence, spherical vesicles appear open, whereas we expect closed spherical objects.
To overcome this limitation, we used a U-Net CNN that takes 3D images as input [@arxiv:1606.06650].
Weigert et al. [@doi:10.1038/s41592-018-0216-7] implemented a U-Net for content-aware restoration (CARE) of 3D fluorescence microscopy datasets. They showed that it can restore information from anisotropic and very noisy datasets.
We implemented a 3D U-Net based on CARE building blocks and trained it with manually segmented datasets. 
This method provided good accuracy and was only slightly affected by the missing wedge artifact. 
Nevertheless, it was not sufficient for our downstream pyto analysis.
Hence, we developed a post-processing method, which transforms the segmented objects into spheres and refines their radius and center location. The procedure includes an outlier detection procedure.
This lead to a substantial accuracy improvement, which are reflected in better pyto performance.
We also introduce a semi-automatic method to very quickly fix wrongly segmented or missed SVs.

Although our set of procedures was developed with the use case of SV segmentation in mind, it can be used to segment any other types of biological spherical vesicles, such as transport vesicles, secretory vesicles, endocytic vesicles, and extracellular vesicles.

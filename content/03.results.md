### Overview of training and workflow
In view of the effort required for the manual segmentation of SVs, we decided to develop an automatic segmentation procedure.
Since we had previously manually segmented a number of tomograms with the program IMOD, we could use these segmentations as the ground truth [@doi:10.1006/jsbi.1996.0013].
We trained a U-Net with a set of 9 segmented tomograms of rat synaptosomes (see Materials and Methods).

We sought to further improve segmentation accuracy by feeding the probability mask output by the U-Net to a series of post-processing steps (Figure {@fig:pipeline}).
Three sets of tomograms were used to assess the performances of the pipeline:

1) Train tomograms : The 9 rat synaptosome tomograms that have been used for U-Net training
2) Test tomograms: 9 additional rat synaptosome tomograms
3) Generalization test tomograms: 12 mouse primary neuronal culture tomograms. 

Each tomogram was split into patches of 32^3^ voxels.
These patches were fed in the U-Net, which outputs a probability mask for those patches.
To obtain a complete probability mask, the patches are stitched back together (Figure {@fig:pipeline}, Figure {@fig:suppl_tom_slice}).
The probability mask was then binarized with a global threshold step.

We noticed that some vesicles were not segmented accurately.
Indeed, some vesicles that were in close proximity were misidentified as a single entity.
Separating them necessitated adjusting the detection threshold to a more stringent value. (see "Adaptative local thresholding" section in Materials and Methods).
Additionally, there were instances where the detection captured only a fraction of a vesicle, which required loosening the threshold for a more accurate segmentation.
Yet the assignment of the correct label to each segmented vesicle was essential for the next steps.

### Sphericalization and radial profile-based refinement
Although at first glance the segmentation looked good after these steps, we noticed that it was not extremely accurate.
For example, the vesicles were not always centered in the segment or the radius of the segment was inexact.
Very often, the vesicle segment looked shrunk in the z-direction, whereas the actual vesicles were spherical.
This would be highly problematic for automatic connector and tether segmentation.
To address these issues, we represented each vesicle as a sphere.
We determined the center and radius of the sphere as described in the Materials and Methods section.
We then performed a radial averaging of the intensity around the center of the sphere.
And we adjusted iteratively the position and radius of the sphere to match the actual structure in the tomogram (Figure {@fig:radial_profile}). The radial profile refinement is a pivotal tool as it ensures that the segmented vesicles are a true representation of their form in the tomogram.

### Outlier detection and refinement
Despite the  improvement brought by the radial profile refinement, some vesicles were still not segmented accurately.
By quantifying several parameters of the segmented vesicles, such as radius, membrane thickness, membrane intensity, lumen intensity, we were able to spot outliers using multivariate statistics (see Materials and Methods).
An example of outlier detection is shown in Figure {@fig:outlier}.
In this example, three outliers are highlighted.
Outlier 1 (red, top row) corresponds to the mistaken segmentation of a non-vesicular membrane-bound structure.
The high mahalanobis distance of this outlier can be explained by a vesicle radius, membrane thickness,  and intensity that are very different from the average of the dataset.
Outlier 2 (green, middle row) is correctly segmented but is flagged for its abnormally high radius.
Indeed, both the membrane thickness and intensity are close to the average of the dataset but the highly increased radius leads to a high mahalanobis distance.
Outlier 3 (blue, bottom row) is initially detected but is misplaced.
Its radius was not divergent from the average but its membrane thickness and intensity were.
We could then refine these outliers or remove them if refinement failed.

The scatter plot (left panel) represents vesicle features in the space defined by membrane intensity, radius, and thickness, with points colored according to the p-value of their Mahalanobis distance, identifying potential outliers. Central panels: outliers are highlighted.  Right panels: outliers have been either removed (top and middle row) or fixed by refinement(bottom row). In addition the right panels show the final vesicle segmentation boundaries. Bars, 100 nm.](images/outlier_intensity_border.png){#fig:outlier width="15cm"}

### Performance and generalization
The performance of all steps was quantitatively assessed by comparing the obtained segmentation with the ground truth using the Dice coefficient metric (see Materials and Methods).
The Dice coefficient of the probability mask was 0.64±0.11 for the train tomograms, 0.75±0.06 for the test tomograms, and 0.69±0.09 for the generalization test tomograms (Table @tbl:train-tomograms, Table @tbl:test-tomograms, Table @tbl:neuron-tomograms, Table @tbl:dice-statistics, Table @tbl:dice-pvalues, and Figure @fig:dice-improv).
The probability mask was then binarized with a global threshold step, which led to a Dice of 0.78±0.04 and 0.80±0.04 in the train and test datasets, respectively, while it led to a slight decrease dice of 0.66±0.09 in the generalization test dataset.
You do not see instantly that localized thresholding step affect the performance significantly however, it is necessarily to avoid false negative vesicles.
The Radial profile refinement and final outlier removal steps led to a Dice coefficients of 0.86±0.05, 0.83±0.05, and 0.79±0.09, respectively.

In addition to the Dice metric, which is a voxel-wise evaluation, we performed a vesicle-wise  evaluation.
Namely, we quantified vesicle diameter deviation, and center residual (Figure @fig:dice-improv, Table @tbl:train-tomograms, Table @tbl:test-tomograms, and Table @tbl:neuron-tomograms).
Results show that our method transfers well across datasets even without fine-tuning which shows robustness and generalization.

### Downstream analysis and application
Traditional manual segmentation, while precise, is time-consuming and often limited in scope. 
In previous cryo-ET studies of presynaptic terminals, the analysis of spatial organization was restricted within 250 nm of the active zone in order to keep segmentation time reasonable.
This limitation inherently narrows the scope of synaptic analyses.
The advent of deep learning-based segmentation offers a promising alternative, providing both speed and scalability.
We were able to segment full synapses in a fraction of the time that it manual segmentation would take.
Furthermore, we have implemented an interactive tool with Napari [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.3555620]  that enables to swiftly rectify false positives and negatives by adding or removing vesicles as needed, ensuring the highest level of accuracy in the final segmented output.
A comparison of manual and automatic segmentation is shown in Figure {@fig:pipelineontomo}.

Pyto is a software package designed for the analysis of pleomorphic membrane-bound molecular complexes in 3D images, particularly in the context of synaptic cryo-ET. 
A key feature of Pyto is its ability to accurately segment connectors and tethers within the pre-synaptic terminal, a task that requires a high level of vesicle segmentation precision. 
This segmentation process is hierarchical and connectivity-based, detecting densities interconnecting vesicles (connectors) and densities connecting vesicles to the active-zone plasma membrane (tethers).
CryoVesNet has been designed to be compatible with Pyto and an application is demonstrated in Figure {@fig:amira}.
This enables us to extract a wealth of structural information to better understand the structural basis of synaptic vesicle exocytosis regulation.

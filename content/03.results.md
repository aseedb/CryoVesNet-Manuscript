Fig 2- U-Net - Input Size is 32^3, in each resolution we have two convolution layer followed by batch normalization layer and relu activation function. Intermediate sizes are written on top of arrows, number of convolution filters is written bottom of boxes. Skip connections shows concatenation of the features from contracting path (left side of the network) and expansive path (right side of the network).

### Comparison of manual segmentation with automatic deep-learning based segmentation
Evaluation metric DICE for pixel/pixel analysis
Global analysis

3d unet good for 3D processing
recent Nature methods paper by Ben Engel, DeepFinder -> Relion for STA creates mask to find more using dl
	-what are they doing, maybe compare that in the text, different aims; we might compare results we achieve (keep as bonus, revision)

3 different types of dl: classification, localization and segmentation
We specialize in accuratly segmenting 3D svs -> results
through the network, output is a mask, smooth DICE/ binary DICE = which one for our mask? one function for both? -> Amin will check
when we encounter error until now we remove sv(?), bug inside function -> fix bug for better performance, how many fail and why?
evaluation: objectwise evaluation for I/O, radius, center (according to nature paper) -> compare with manual seg
	other common evaluation tool other than DICE (Amin wants to check)

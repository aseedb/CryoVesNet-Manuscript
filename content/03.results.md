## Results

In view of the effort required for the manual segmentation of SVs, we decided to develop an automatic segmentation procedure.
Since we had previously manually segmented a number of tomograms with the program IMOD, we could use these segmentations as the ground truth [@doi:10.1006/jsbi.1996.0013].
We trained a U-Net with a set of 9 segmented tomograms of rat synaptosomes (see Materials and Methods).

We seeked to further improve segmentation accuracy by feeding the probability mask output by the U-Net to a series of postprocess steps (Figure {@fig:pipeline}).
Three sets of tomograms were used to assess the performances of the pipeline:

1) Training dataset : The 9 rat synaptosome tomograms that had been used for U-Net training
2) Testing dataset: 9 additional rat synaptosome tomograms
3) Transfer learning testing dataset: 12 mouse primary neuronal culture tomograms. 

Each tomogram was split into patches of 32^3^ voxels.
These patches were fed in the U-Net, which output a probability mask for those patches.
To obtain a complete probability mask, the patches are stitched back together.
The probability mask was binarized first with a global threshold value and then with an adaptative localized thresholding steps (Figure {@fig:pipeline}, Figure {@fig:tom}).

Indeed the global thresholding did not capture vesicles accurately in different regions of the tomograms.
Specifically, when vesicles were in close proximity misidentified as a single entity, necessitating a more stringent adjustment of the detection threshold.
Additionally, there were instance where the detection captured only a fraction of a particular vesicle, which required loosening the threshold for a more accurate segmentation. 

Although at first glance the segmentation looked quite good after these steps, we noticed that it was not extremely accurate.
For example, the vesicles were not always centered in the segment or the radius of the segment was inexact.
Very often, the vesicle segment looked shrunk in the z-direction, whereas the actual vesicles were spherical.
To address these issues, we represented each vesicle as a sphere.
We determined the center and radius of the sphere as described in the Materials and Methods section.
We then performed a radial averaging of the intensity around the center of the sphere.
And we adjusted iteratively the position and radius of the sphere to match the actual structure in the tomogram (Figure {@fig:radial_profile}). The radial profile refinement is a pivotal tool as it ensures that the segmented vesicles are a true representation of their form in the tomogram.

(E-H) Same as (A-D) after refinement.](images/radial_avg_115-139.svg){#fig:radial_profile width="15cm"}

Despite the great improvement brought by the radial profile refinement, some vesicles were still not segmented accurately.
By quantifying several parameters of the segmented vesicles, such as radius, membrane thickness, membrane intensity, lumen intensity, we were able to spot outliers (see Materials and Methods).
We could then refine these outliers or remove them if refinement failed.

Several quantification metrics were used to assess the accuracy of the annotation within the different tomograms for each step of our pipeline (Figure @fig:dice-improv, Table @tbl:train-tomograms, Table @tbl:test-tomograms, and Table @tbl:neuron-tomograms}. These consist of DICE, diameter deviation, and center residual.
Results show that Our method transfers well across datasets even without fine-tuning which shows robustness and generalization.

### Comparison of manual segmentation with automatic deep-learning based segmentation

In the realm of cryo-electron tomography (cryoET), accurate segmentation of synaptic structures is paramount for understanding their spatial organization and function.
Traditional manual segmentation, while precise, is time-consuming and often limited in scope.
The advent of deep learning-based segmentation offers a promising alternative, providing both speed and scalability.

The traditional approach to manual segmentation in cryoET studies often restricted analyses to specific distances from the active zone, typically up to 250 nm.
This limitation inherently narrows the scope of synaptic or neuronal analyses.
However, with the integration of deep learning-based segmentation, it's now feasible to analyze entire synaptosomes or neurons comprehensively.
Not only does this method expedite the segmentation process, but it also enhances the accuracy and breadth of the analysis.
Furthermore, interactive tools like Napari significantly augment this process, allowing researchers to swiftly rectify false positives and negatives by adding or removing vesicles as needed, ensuring the highest level of accuracy in the final segmented output.

###  Hierarchical connectivity segmentation of presynaptic terminals
Pyto is a software package designed for the analysis of pleomorphic membrane-bound molecular complexes in 3D images, particularly in the context of cryo-electron tomograms of neuronal synapses. A key feature of Pyto is its ability to accurately segment connectors and tethers within the pre-synaptic terminal, a task that requires a high level of precision. This segmentation process is hierarchical and connectivity-based, detecting densities interconnecting vesicles (connectors) and densities connecting vesicles to the active-zone plasma membrane (tethers).

In the study of synaptic vesicles regulation, the precision of segmentation is crucial. Accurate segmentation of connectors and tethers is essential as these structures play a significant role in the regulation of synaptic vesicles. Software that segments subcellular compartments, such as Pyto, provides a valuable tool in this process.

We have developed a software that is designed to be compatible with programs like Pyto. This compatibility allows us to extract more detailed information from Cryo-Electron Tomography (Cryo-ET), even in densely populated in situ conditions. By using our software in conjunction with programs like Pyto, we can gain a deeper understanding of synaptic vesicles regulation. Importantly, our software aims to eliminate the need for manual segmentation, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of the process.

## Results


### Comparison of manual segmentation with automatic deep-learning based segmentation
Evaluation metric DICE for pixel/pixel analysis
Global analysis



3d unet good for 3D processing
recent Nature methods paper by Ben Engel, DeepFinder -> Relion for STA creates mask to find more using dl
	-what are they doing, maybe compare that in the text, different aims; we might compare results we achieve (keep as bonus, revision)

3 different types of dl: classification, localization and segmentation
We specialize in accuratly segmenting 3D svs -> results
through the network, output is a mask, smooth DICE/ binary DICE = which one for our mask? one function for both? -> Amin will check
when we encounter error until now we remove sv(?), bug inside function -> fix bug for better performance, how many fail and why?
evaluation: objectwise evaluation for I/O, radius, center (according to nature paper) -> compare with manual seg
	other common evaluation tool other than DICE (Amin wants to check)

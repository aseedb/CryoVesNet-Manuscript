## Discussion

While the Dice coefficient is a good global measure to assess the predictions in comparison to the ground truth, it is difficult to asses local segmentation accurracy. 
For example, a single generated vesicle label containing several close connected vesicles would not be practical for further analysis for the researcher although it could have almost the same dice value. 
What is important for actual usage of the software would be the number and percentage of true-detected vesicles, false-positive and false-negative rates.

### Version One:
Discussion

The realm of synaptic vesicles (SVs) and their interactions at the synapse is a fascinating and complex area of study in cellular biology. These vesicles play a pivotal role in neurotransmission, and understanding their behavior, interactions, and associated protein complexes is crucial for a comprehensive grasp of synaptic function.

Synaptic Vesicles and Their Interactions

At the heart of synaptic transmission lies the process of neurotransmitter release, which is orchestrated by a series of coordinated actions involving multiple protein complexes. Synaptic vesicles undergo a series of states, from tethering to priming, before they release their neurotransmitter contents into the synaptic cleft. This process is not just about the vesicles themselves but also about the intricate dance of protein complexes that facilitate these states.

Tethering represents the initial stage where vesicles are held close to the plasma membrane, readying them for the subsequent steps. This is followed by priming, a state where vesicles are molecularly prepared for neurotransmitter release. The transition between these states involves specific protein bridges, with proteins like Munc13 playing a role in localizing vesicles close to the plasma membrane. The orchestration of these transitions is further modulated by other proteins and enzymes, such as protein kinase C, which influences vesicle interactions.

The Role of Synapsins in Vesicle Clustering

Beyond the protein complexes that facilitate vesicle states, there are proteins like synapsins that play a crucial role in maintaining the reserve pool of SVs in presynaptic terminals. This reserve pool is essential as it ensures that there are always vesicles available for neurotransmission, especially during heightened synaptic activity. The exact mechanism through which synapsins maintain this reserve pool has been a topic of debate. Some theories suggest that synapsins might cross-link vesicles, anchoring them to each other, while others propose that synapsins create a unique liquid phase, allowing vesicles to float within a synapsin droplet. Both models offer intriguing insights into the potential mechanisms of vesicle clustering and reserve pool maintenance.

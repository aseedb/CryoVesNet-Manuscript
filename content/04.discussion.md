## Discussion

While the Dice coefficient is a good global measure to assess the predictions in comparison to the ground truth, it is difficult to asses local segmentation accurracy. 
For example, a single generated vesicle label containing several close connected vesicles would not be practical for further analysis for the researcher although it could have almost the same dice value. 
What is important for actual usage of the software would be the number and percentage of true-detected vesicles, false-positive and false-negative rates. 

Center error:
If we measure each axis error it will reveal that human bias in segmentation is more affected on the Z-axis. [we didn't show it in number but its checked the hypothesis]
`\_we cannot claim something without showing it. ---> this would belong into results*`{.green}

3d unet good for 3D processing
recent Nature methods paper by Ben Engel, DeepFinder -> Relion for STA creates mask to find more using dl
-what are they doing, maybe compare that in the text, different aims; we might compare results we achieve (keep as bonus, revision)

### Outlook
implement automatic cell-outline and active zone segmentation as deep learning workflow using UNet
implement automatic connector and tether segmentation as a deep leaning workflow using UNet

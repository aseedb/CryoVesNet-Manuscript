## Discussion

Our methodological approach to automatic segmentation in cryoET represents a significant advancement in the field. 
By utilizing a U-Net architecture trained on manually segmented tomograms and postprocessing steps, we have developed a system that can efficiently and accurately segment synaptic vesicles in tomographic datasets. 
In particular, CryoVesSeg is uniquely insensitive to the missing wedge, and can segment complete vesicles even if the membrane is not fully visible in the tomogram.
The results obtained from our method, as evidenced by the Dice coefficient and other evaluation metrics, demonstrate its robustness and accuracy. 
Notably, our method's ability to generalize across different datasets, namely from rat synaptosomes and to primary neuronal cultures, underscores its versatility and potential for widespread application.
It is not restricted to synaptic vesicles but can be applied to any spherical membrane-bound organelle. 

The use of both global and adaptive localized thresholding techniques further refines the segmentation, addressing challenges posed by closely packed vesicles. 
Our results also highlight the effectiveness of our post-processing steps, including radial profile refinement and the removal of outliers. 
The radial profile, in particular, ensures that the segmented vesicles closely match their actual structure in the tomogram, providing a more accurate representation.
Furthermore, our method compatibility with software like Pyto, which is designed for the analysis of pleomorphic membrane-bound molecular complexes in 3D images, enhances its utility. 
By integrating our segmentation approach with tools like Pyto, researchers can gain deeper insights into vesicle interactions.

In conclusion, CryoVesSeg for automatic segmentation in cryoET represents a significant step forward in the study of synaptic vesicles and their associated structures. 
By combining the power of deep learning with optimized post-processing techniques, we offer a solution that is both efficient and precise. 
As the field of structural cell biology continues to evolve, tools like ours will play a crucial role in advancing our understanding of complex cellular structures and processes.

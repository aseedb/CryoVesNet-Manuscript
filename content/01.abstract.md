## Abstract {.page_break_before}

The communication between neurons is based on the exocytosis of neurotransmitter filled vesicles.
Even small disbalances in this delicate system can result in different disorders.
Numerous questions are still unanswered about synaptic vesicle exocytosis regulation as well as about which proteins affect this fundamental process.
Hundreds to thousands of vesicles are present at the synapse and most of them are interconnected.
There is a number of evidence suggesting that the connectivity between the vesicles influences synaptic vesicle exocytotic activity and that connectivity can be regulated.
To address these issues, cryo-electron tomography is a method of choice.
Yet inevitable quantitative studies require accurate segmentation of both synaptic vesicles and the interconnecting filaments.

This segmentation process has been widely recognized as a bottleneck by the community.
When working with synapses, an incredibly tedious cellular feature to segment are synaptic vesicles.
Even though they have a very homogeneous shape and size, which makes it easy to distinguish them from other cellular features, their high occurrence makes their segmentation challenging (one average-sized synapse or synaptosomes can easily contain between 300-500 synaptic vesicles).

Several attempts at utilizing machine learning algorithms  to automize the segmentation of synaptic vesicles yielded in unfavorable results.
We analyzed these approaches and realized that most algorithms solely worked with the 2D image planes within the tomogram, but didnâ€™t tap into their 3D information and therefore increased the weight of the missing wedge.

We designed a framework that consists of two parts: 1) U-Net convolutional network to obtain mask for SVs following by 2) post-processing step which fine-tunes the mask and provides entire 3D-vesicles.
A deep-learning model has been trained with manually segmented synaptic vesicles, which have been entirely annotated as 3D objects.
By post-processing, we achieved to transfer the vesicle recognition through this pipeline.
The evaluation metrics like the DICE value suggest a very high success rate.

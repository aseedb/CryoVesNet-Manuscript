## Materials and methods

### Cryo-electron Tomography Datasets

Two datasets of different origin were used as input and test subjects for the automatic segmentation pipeline, respectively.
They consisted in rat synaptosomes primary neuron cultures derived from mice.
The preparation procedure of the samples from which the datasets were obtained as well as the biological analysis of these datasets was previously reported  [@doi:10.1101/2022.03.07.483217].

### Manual segmentation and automatic interboundary segment detection

Manual segmentation of SVs, mitochondria, the active zone PM, and of the segmentation region was done in IMOD (???Figure S4A&B???) [@10.1006/jsbi.1996.0013]. SVs were segmented as spheres.
The segmentation region marked the region to be analyzed by Pyto [@doi:10.1016/j.jsb.2016.10.004].
The analysis by Pyto was essentially the same as described previously [@doi:10.1083/jcb.200908082; @doi:10.1016/j.jsb.2016.10.004].
In short, the segmented region is divided in 1 voxel thick layers parallel to the active zone for distance calculations.
A hierarchical connectivity segmentation detects densities interconnecting boundaries.
The boundaries were synaptic vesicles and the active zone PM. Detected intervesicular segments are termed connectors and segments connecting vesicles to the active zone PM are called tethers (Figure `\_add figure number*`{.green}).
Distance calculations respective to SVs were done from SV center.
The segmentation procedure is conservative and tends to miss some tethers and connectors because of noise.
Consequently, the numbers of tethers and connectors should not be considered as absolute values, but rather to compare experimental groups.
As it was done before, an upper limit was set between 2100 and 3200 nm^3^ on segment volume.
The tomograms that were used for this analysis were binned by a factor of 2 to 3, resulting in voxel sizes between 2.1 and 2.4 nm.

### Pre-processing of manual segmentation outputs from IMOD for further use (jupyter notebook pre-pyto)
`probably not necessary to mention output from IMOD to prepyto input label file procedure`

`put this somewhere else`{.green}
The used datasets included a total of 30 tomograms with heterogeneous pixel sizes, defocus and resolution. 

1. 9 synaptosome datasets were used for training and validation.
2. 9 synaptosome datasets was used for test.
3. 12 Neuron dataset were used for assessing transfer learning potential. 

### Network architecture and training procedure

We used a U-Net of depth 2, two convolutional layers per depth, a convolutional kernel size of 3, and ReLU activation function based on the open-source CARE framework (Figure {@fig:unet}) [@doi:10.1038/s41592-018-0216-7]. 
Datasets were prepared by splitting the 3D tomographic volume of synaptosomes into 32^3^-voxel subvolumes and keeping only subvolumes occupied by a sufficient amount (> 1000 voxels) of binarized vesicle label.
860 subvolumes were used for training and 100 subvolumes were used for validation.
We used the Adam optimizer on a binary cross-entropy loss function.

### U-Net output threshold refinement

The probability mask output by the U-Net was first made binary by determining a global threshold value. To this end, the mask was binarized for a range of threshold values comprised between 0.8 and 1. For each probability value a 1-voxel thick label shell  was computed. 
The shell mask was then applied on the input data and the average masked voxel intensity was computed.
Since the shell of correctly segmented vesicles corresponds to the vesicle membrane, we expect low intensity pixels.
The threshold value resulting in the minimal average intensity of the shell masked voxels was used as the global threshold.  
`Amin please write the equations for these steps`{.green}.
The probability mask was binarized using the global threshold and was each separate segment was assigned an individual label with `scikit-image label` method.


A majority of vesicles were correctly segmented but we noticed some segments included two vesicles.
We therefore evaluated each segment with two criteria based on the fact that synaptic vesicles have a homogenous size and are spherical. 
Firstly we calculated the volume z-score $z$ for each segment:
$$z(S_i) = \frac{v(S_i) - \mu(v(S_1\ldots n))}{\sigma(v(S_1\ldots n))}$$ {#eq:z-score-volume}
where $S_i$ is the subvolume $i$ of the dataset $S$, $v(S_i)$ is the volume of segment $i$, $\mu(v(S_1\ldots n))\$ the average segment volume, and $\sigma(v(S_1\ldots n))$ the standard deviation of the segment volumes.
Secondly, we computed the segment extent $e$:
$$e(S_i) = \frac{v(S_i)}{b(S_i)}$$ {#eq:extent}
where  $b(S_i)$ is the volume of segment bounding box.
The extent of a sphere equals $\frac{\pi}{6}$.
Segments with both a z-score $z > 1$ and an extent $e < 0.25$ were considered as potentially comprising two vesicles.
For each of these segments, the probability mask threshold was increased until two distinct segments were generated.


#### Radial Profile

`\_@Benoit?*`{.green}

#### Outlier Removal

The feature space of predicted vesicle labels was defined, containing thickness, membrane density, and estimated radius of a vesicle. `\_@Benoit: after radial profile, we can add the definition of thinness and membrane as well*`{.blue}
To detect outliers in this multivariate space, Mahalanobis Distance (MD) was applied to calculate L2 norm distance on normalized variables using the covariance matrix of observation.
As an additional way to detect outliers, the p-value of MD was calculated, bringing this evaluation setup in iterative form.
If the MD p-value of a specific vesicle was not in a specific margin range (0-10), their radial profile was recalculated, and the label entirely removed if they again failed to pass the margin of the p-value.

### Analysis of Results

The evaluation framework was designed to assess the capabilities of the proposed toolbox for automatic synaptic vesicle segmentation.
The framework was not only designed to evaluate quantitatively performance of the neural network, but rather assay the segmentation of vesicles in practice `\_unsure what the last part means*`{.green}. `\_I tried to say we develop the software rather than an algorithm paper with ablation study kinda more trasnfer learning but however for tranfer learning we might need add finetunning the network or say this sentence in other way*`{.green}.
The pipeline also generates a specific output format, which is necessary to further analyze the presynaptic tomograms via another pre-developed toolbox (Pyto), which segments small molecular filaments associated to the synaptic vesicles, titled tethers and connectors.

#### DICE

The `\_general form??*`{.green} DICE coefficient for probabilistic subvolume maps was calculated after each epoch as a performance quantification while `\_during?*`{.green} training.
The probabilistic mask subvolumes were stitched back together, creating a probabilistic map of the whole tomogram. 
The Soft-DICE for the whole tomogram was calculated to evaluate the similarity of the predicted probability mask with ground truth. 
Note that soft-dice is equivalent to dice, when the input is binarized (which we will do at the end of the post-processing).


$$1-\frac{2\sum_{pixels} y_{true} y_{pred}%}{\sum_{pixels} y_{true}^2+\sum_{pixels} y_{pred}^2}$$

`\_shouln't it be voxels instead of pixels??*`{.green}
`\_yes voxel is right*`{.green}

THE DICE was also employed to monitor all stages of post-processing on the eventual label file, to observe the effect of each post-processing step.

#### Diameter Error

The diameter of a vesicle is one of its relevant characterizations, and it is predefined (see Outlier Removal). 
`\_which diameters are we using in this evaluation as input, pre- or post-outlier removal?*`{.green}
`\_after! I meant from that perentesis that radius or dimater we assume as one charectiristic of vesicle we might can write it better *`{.green}
The error of diameter estimation of true-detected vesicle is defined as 1 minus the proportion of diameters 

$$\delta d=1-\frac{min(dSi,dGTi)}{max(dSi,dGTi)}$$ {#eq:regular-equation}

where dGTi is the diameter of each true manual segmented vesicle, and dSi is the diameter of its estimation.

#### Center error

The center error is an euclidean distance of ground truth and corresponds to true predicted vesicles `\_true pos or true neg*`{.green}.
A vesicle was defined as a true-detected vesicle if the predicted center was located inside the hand-segmented vesicle and the other way around the center of prediction was located inside the predicted vesicle. 
`\_isn't this a bit too general, shouldn't this be a tighter evaluation?*`{.green}
`\_we assume this as hard condition to be true postive we could define like some % liek 50% intersection but this condition is generally harder`{.green}
This means the volume of intersection of the estimated vesicle with the distance of d to a ground truth vesicle with radius R is: 

$$V=\frac{1}{12}\pi(4R+d)(2R-d)$$

## Materials and methods

### Cryo-electron Tomography Datasets

Two datasets of different origin were used as input and test subjects for the automatic segmentation pipeline, rat synaptosomes as well as astrocytic and neural cell cultures derived from mice.

#### Rat synaptosomes

The preparation of the rat synaptosomes were previously described [@doi:10.1038/nprot.2008.171].
After the purification, the synaptosomes were incubated for 30min at room temperature.
1.3mM CaCl2 and 10 nm gold fiducials were added (gold fiducials, #s10110/8. AURION Immuno Gold Reagents & Accessories. Wageningen, The Neatherlands).
The synaptosome solution was applied to a 200-mesh lacey finder carbon film grid (#AGS166-H2. Agar Scientific. Elektron Technology UK Ltd. Stansted, UK).
Manual blotting was used to remove exess liquid with the aid of a filter paper.
Thereafter the grid was immediately plunge frozen in liquid ethane using a homebuilt plunge freezer controlled with a LabView script (National Onstruments Corporation. Mopac Expwy Austin, TX, USA).
The grids coated with rat synaptosomes were mounted in a cryo-holder (Gatan, Pleasonton, CA, USA) and transferred to a Tecnai F20 (FEI, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) which was set to low dose conditions, operated at 200 kV, and equipped with a field emission gun.
Images were recorded with a 2k x 2k CCD camera (Gatan) mounted after a GIF Tridiem post-column filter (Gatan) operated in zero-loss mode.
The sample was kept at about -180°C.
Tilt series were acquired using SerialEM [@doi:10.1016/j.jsb.2005.07.007] for automated acquisition recorded typically from -50° to 50° with a 2° angular increment and an unbinned pixel size of 0.75 or 1.2 nm.
Due to sample thickness (400-700 nm), tomograms were usually not recorded with higher tilt angles.
Defocus was set between -8 to -12 µm and the total electron dose used was about 80-100 e^-^/Å^2^.
Some tomograms were acquired at a Titan Krios equipped with a K2 direct electron detector (Gatan) without energy filter.
The K2 camera was operated in superresolution counting mode and between 8-40 frames per tilt angle were taken.
Tilt series were acquired using the Latitude software (Gatan) for automated acquisition recorded typically from -60° to 60° with a 2° angular increment and an unbinned pixel size of 0.6 nm.
Defocus was set between -8 to -12 µm and the total electron dose used was about 80-100 e^-^/Å^2^.
Prior to image processing the frames at each tilt angle, frames were aligned and averaged in 2dx MC_Automator [@doi:10.1016/j.jsb.2014.03.016] with motioncor [@doi:10.1038/nmeth.2472].
3D reconstruction was done in IMOD [@doi:10.1006/jsbi.1996.0013].
The alignments were done using the automated fiducial tracking function and the 3D reconstructions were done using the weighted back projection followed by a nonlinear anisotropic diffusion (NAD) filtering.

#### Astrocytic and neuronal mouse culture

The preparation of astrocytic and neuronal culture has been published before [@doi:10.3791/50783].
After 12 to 14 days of incubation grids with mouse neurons were plunge frozen with a Vitrobot (Thermofisher Scientific, Mark IV) with a blot time of 3 s and a blot force of -10. Wait time and drain time were not used. Humidity was set to 100% at 4°C. 4 undiluteted 10 nm BSA gold tracer (Aurion) was added directly onto the grid prior to plunge freezing.
Cultured mouse neurons tilt series were acquired at a Titan Krios, equipped with a Falcon 3 direct electron detector (Thermofisher Scientific) without energy filter.
The Falcon camera was operated in linear mode.
Tilt series were acquired using the TEM Tomography software (TFS) for automated acquisition recorded typically from -60° to 60° with a 2° angular increment and an unbinned pixel size of 0.37 nm.
Defocus was set between -6 to -10 µm and the total electron dose used was about 80-100 e^-^/Å^2^.
Tomogram reconstruction was done in the same way as for the synaptosome datasets.

### Manual segmentation procedures

Manual segmentation of SVs, mitochondria, and the active zone PM was done in IMOD (Figure S4A&B).
The boundary marked the region to be analyzed by Pyto [@doi:10.1016/j.jsb.2016.10.004].
The analysis by Pyto was essentially the same as described previously [@doi:10.1083/jcb.200908082] [@doi:10.1016/j.jsb.2016.10.004].

In short, the segmented area is divided in 1 voxel thick layers parallel to the active zone for distance calculations.
A hierarchical connectivity segmentation detects densities interconnecting vesicles (so called connectors) and densities connecting vesicles to the active zone PM (so called tethers) (Figure S4C).
Distance calculations are done with the center of the vesicle.
Mainly default settings were used.
The segmentation procedure is conservative and tends to miss some tethers and connectors because of noise.
Consequently, the numbers of tethers and connectors should not be considered as absolute values but rather to compare experimental groups.
As it was done before, an upper limit was set between 2100 and 3200 nm3 on segment volume.
The tomograms that were used for this analysis were binned by a factor of 2 to 3, resulting in voxel sizes between 2.1 and 2.4 nm.
